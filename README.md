### This is my pet project, the essence of which is user registration, verification and authorization.

-   The project was written on TS using the following technologies: Axios, React, Redux, Node, Express, Mongoose and JWT.
-   Implemented: [Registration of a new user, Email verification, Uploading a profile photo, Exiting the profile, Logging in using user data
    and Receiving data via cookies].
-   Data validation is present on the registration and login forms. Validation is present both on the server and on the client
